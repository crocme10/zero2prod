# Cucumber for Integration Testing

## Motivations

The test specifications act as a contract between multiple parties (eg project
manager, developer, tester, ...). This contract should be comprehensive and
written in a language understood by all. This is what cucumber provides through
its [Gherkin Syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)
